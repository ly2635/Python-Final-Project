l12p6mo,FrecciaRosa,441,"If interest rates go down, housing prices go up. If interest rates go up, housing prices go up."
l12v43j,Brasilionaire,63,"Housing prices will never stop going up barring a nasty economic recession. 

Honestly, even if a ton of boomers die and inventory is released, their kids will either move in from a rental situation (can’t blame them) or investors will seize them to make it perma-rentals (**can** blame them, fuck them)"
l12pg7i,shibby5000,28,The question that needs to be considered is under what economic conditions would interest rates go down and how that would influence demand. Generally rates are cut when the economy is under distress (rising unemployment etc)
l12xxgk,Junkbot-TC,24,"Buy a house with a payment you can afford now when you need a house.  If interest rates go up, you're already locked in at a payment you can afford.  If interest rates go down you can refinance and save yourself some additional cash.


The issue with the current high rates is that home prices haven't really dropped.  A house that was previously affordable at 3-4% is no longer affordable at 6-7%."
l12o0mg,Background_Bag_9073,41,"Technically houses do go up averaged every year, what I think interest rate makes a difference is when it does goes down then demand for houses becomes competitive thus resulting on competitive offers for every single house, which is why most people advise to buy when you are ready and not time the market."
l12qu0u,MNCPA,26,"In theory, yes. In real life, no.


Example. I had my home reappraised recently. The appraiser asked what value I needed and bam, I home was appraised above that amount. 

Fast forward a few months, my neighbor goes to sell his home. What do you know? My home was listed as a value comparison for his home. My home value went up, so his sales price went up.



Tldr - home prices are magical numbers which rise/fall when requested."
l133f3l,presidentKoby,8,"Housing prices are sticky because they are often appraised based on the sales price of recently-transacted homes in the same neighborhood. Americans had lots of excess savings during the COVID lockdowns, so that, coupled with free money (ie low interest rates) led to an abnormal rate of increase in housing prices. 

Savings have dried up, and many Americans are locked into 2-4% mortgages, so it rates went down to 5% I don't think we'd see a sudden spike in prices. I think prices will grow quicker with lower interest rates but even if we saw 2-3% mortgage rates again I don't think we'd see the same rate of increase as during COVID because of the lower savings balances"
l12o43w,Herdnerfer,16,"Interest rates going down makes demand for homes go up, demand going up is what makes housing prices rise as well."
l143lmb,MustangEater82,5,"If interest rates drop, remember there are a ton of people on the sidelines waiting for rates to drop to jump in and buy, potentially raising prices and reducing inventory."
l13a1av,helljacket,2,">My question, then, is that were interests rates to dip, would the market just adjust and inflate the price of the houses so that that same 375k house would in fact be 500k (roughly speaking) and the mortgage payments for all these houses would be the same.

Housing prices are a product of supply and demand, just like any other price.  If the supply increases (e.g., more sellers put their house on the market because they are tired of waiting for interest rates to go down) with constant demand, price goes down.  If demand increases based on buyers being able to offer more money with lower interest rates and constant supply, housing prices will go up.  

The problem with housing price discussions is that it's very specific to a geographical market.  If you lower interest rates, but your geographic area has no attraction for high earners (e.g., doctors/lawyers/ tech guys in FAANG), there's no reason necessarily house prices will increase in that area.  It heavily depends on the market clearing price for a given area.

On the other hand, geographic areas don't exist in a vacuum.  If the upper middle class can't afford a house in the very nice areas, they'll only buy houses in the nice areas, which pushes the middle-middle class to buy houses in the ok areas, which pushes the lower middle class to buy houses in the bad areas."
l13ys7c,Nodeal_reddit,2,Yes. It seems like it would be good to buy a house now and refinance later when rates fall. Especially if you’re buying a first home.
l14176p,brilliantpebble9686,2,Do debtpigs roll in shit?
l141jut,,2,"Now is the time to seriously start looking. IF rates drop next year, you can refinance. Otherwise yes, prices are going to start soaring again. Your call."
l145l6i,Longjumping-Buy-5994,2,"The only things that bring housing prices down are a recession or a catch up in supply. We are a ways away from having enough homes, and the Fed hasn’t allowed a recession in 11 years, so good luck."
l14l20b,iridescent-shimmer,2,"Interest rates going down do make housing prices inflate, which is why we're seeing a very very slow deflation. People have been so used to low rates for so long, and that was because the government wanted to incentivize home buying to recover from the great financial crisis. I think the housing market is tough right now for that reason, but it'll stabilize within the next few years. Buy the house you can afford when you need it and don't worry that much about the greater market forces. Buy a house because you need somewhere to live, not purely as an investment. And also, no. Home values (prices relative to inflation rates) don't always go up. Anyone telling you that is either ignorant or dishonest."
l18sq06,ButterscotchFluffy59,2,"In theory, if interest rates go way down quickly, the economy is in trouble and many homes hit the market.  When there is high supply the prices fall..."
l12oigb,Sheerbucket,1,Yes.
l12spjj,NW_Forester,1,The rationale reaction to interest rate increases is price declines and to interest rate declines to be price increases. But the housing market hasn't been acting rationale for a few years. So who knows what it will do.
l131il1,,1,yes. The slowdown on price increases was directly caused by raising interest rates but lack of supply is still a major constraint on cheaper housing.
l13kbep,dfwagent84,1,"Yes
 Competition will increase. Supply and demand"
l13ltmd,skoltroll,1,"Likely yes, but to what degree depends on the market's supply vs demand. If you can get 375k and afford it w/o killing your finances or stretching it beyond your comfort zone, go for it. \*IF\* rates drop in a few years, you can re-fi and roll the fees into the new loan.

But if you buy now, you're paying principal towards a future, bigger downpayment on the next home."
l13npr6,josephbenjamin,1,"Interest rates aren’t going down too low unless the Fed has to intervene if a recession happens. In that case, it is anyone’s guess at what happens."
l13nqm5,ahhquantumphysics,1,"No matter what house prices go up, but yes, in general if rates go down it increases demand which increases prices"
l13oac1,DomesticMongol,1,Yes but not to that extent.
l13osuz,,1,If interest rates go down you will have more buyers interested in buying and financing bigger mortgages.  Eventually the increased interest will push prices up as more buyers compete for properties.
l13zguk,Reader47b,1,"When interest rates are lower, demand for houses tends to go up, and when demand goes up (but supply doesn't go up likewise), prices go up. But other factors can repress demand (like if we're in a recession or if the first-time home-buying-aged population declines). So it depends what else is going on."
l141ia3,Zuboloma,1,"If you can afford 7 now and in a few years, the rates go down you could refinance to that lower rate, you would need to pay some closing cost money to do so, but it might be cheaper in the long run."
l149yqz,DSF_27,1,Yeah probably. People can afford to buy more so home sellers will raise prices.
l14az6u,fwast,1,"the issue right now, is that there is nothing hurting people holding on to pre pandemic interest rate mortgages. Until there is a spike in the unemployment rate, you won't see home prices really fall. It might run flat for the time being with low inventory. I'm watching anything decent that's listed get eaten up. Just the garbage houses are having a really hard time right now."
l14r1zr,reasonableconjecture,1,"Maybe, maybe not. Theoretically, lowering interest rates could cause some people holding on to their homes to list them which would increase supply and exert downward pressure on prices. Of course, lower rates could bring more people into the market increasing demand. Also, lower rates don't take into account how much people have saved for down payments. People aren't going to magically have the down payment for a 500K house just because rates go down a couple percentage points."
l14rgm2,coolformula,1,"I think under normal times the higher rates would push prices down.  They are blaming the builders who quit back in 2008, and we have a shortage.  

  
So shortage from lack of building for 15  years.  

Shortage cause if you have sub 4% rate who is selling to get a 7% rate especially on upgrades.  How many millions of people refuse to upgrade due to this factor? 

The housing seems to be all messed up from these factors and others.  

I do think if rates go down say to 5.5% a lot would happen.  Demand would go up (lower payments), but how many people also might want to upgrade their home or downsize?  How many units would come back on the market would this help enough?  

The housing really puts people in lower middle class or HCOL in a super bind I feel like."
l14z3kl,SeatEqual,1,"Technically there is no direct connection. Mortgage rates are driven by the economy amd the prime rate. Housing prices are drive by supply vs. demand. What you are seeing is that rates will drop overnight if the Federal Reserve drips their rates. But that has no such impact on supply vs demand... certainly not in the short term. In a seller's market, when the rates drop, the sellers know they can sell for more and buyers can get the same payment since the rate dropped because demand is greater than supply. In a buyers market, with supply greater than demand, sellers cannot do that or they risk being overpriced compared to other sellers who don't raise their price. At last, in any market, the unknown will always be how motivated the seller is to sell their house...are they moving in a month for a new job or are they just testing the waters."
l158tfn,SleepingLimbs1,1,"In theory yes, but even when interest rates went up, houses didn’t really decrease in price except in some markets that were already over priced. The reason being is because the market inventory was already low, and when interest rates went up, it made the inventory even lower because there were much fewer sellers. I wouldn’t hope for housing prices to go down anytime soon unless we have a black swan event. It’s all guess work on what will happen once interest rates go down, but I expect some increase in price, and I expect people will pay it."
l15bufn,panconquesofrito,1,Unemployment or insurance are the only things taking this housing market down.
l15gkfi,cartman_returns,1,"Housing prices are based on supply vs demand period

If rates go down demand goes up and prices go up

The only way prices go down is if supply is greater then demand, that would require a major recession where people are forced to sell houses because they can not afford to pay on them"

l16fscw,,1,In a normally functioning economy a house’s value rises in pace with inflation. Ours is not a normally functioning economy.
l16v42k,Ptstu,1,"Yes, but it’s limited by incomes. Remember, the fed wants people to lose jobs. As they do, interest rates will fall. For a brief moment you’ll see prices go up. But when all the foreclosures hit the market, prices will start to go down."
l17hnhu,Travmuney,1,"Yes. All the people thinking they’re gonna catch the bottom of real estate if they lower rates are mistaken. For every one middle class person that gets a cheaper priced house, 9 investors with deep pockets will swoop in and buy the other 9. Then the bitching and complaining will just take a new form"
l17jcqd,Able_Worker_904,1,"Does housing ever go down, outside of a great financial crisis/depression? And even then, does it go down for more than a few years?"
l17oc8a,Striking_Computer834,1,Yes. That's why people accuse the Fed of being responsible for spiking housing prices (and other commodities like gold and oil) sky high over the last 20 years … because of the artificially low interest rates. The rates we're seeing today are historically normal rates. The past 20 years were an anamoly.
l18oan5,Specific-Peanut-8867,1,"Only if the demand goes up in the supply stays the same

The biggest challenge right now is limited supply"
l18w4ib,wildcat12321,1,"If that was the only change, sure...Most people are buying based on a monthly payment. As money gets cheaper, they can get more for their money, so they tend to buy up, which increases competition and raises prices.

But interest rates usually go down when the economy gets worse, so you might have other effects at play as well.

a 375k house won't jump to 500k quickly just from interest rates. but it is a lot of why we have high house prices today -- people bought high the past few years given low rates"
l1904ys,myrenjobra,1,"If interest rates go down that means the fed has pivoted. So far they have only held rates steady which means inflation is still rampant. In an environment where fed pivots, that means inflation has been sufficiently curtailed. The only way inflation comes down is if there is economic pain. All that being said, when interest rates come down, I dont think housing prices will show any significant increases because sufficient money supply will have been excised from the economy. Less people will be able to afford homes and thus, the demand will soften at that point in time. 

One also has to consider that a sudden appreciation in home price will not be favorable to the majority of the populace whose wages are simply not keeping up.

Investors will realize that although they may be able to buy these new homes to rent out, they will be cashflow negative as wages will not be able to keep up with the rising rents required of those units."
l190j4u,yoitsmollyo,1,"Theoretically that is what would happen if corporations weren't snapping up the inventory paying in cash. In reality, yeah they might go up a bit, but they're already artificially high."
l195nea,Potential-Ad1139,1,"There are a lot of factors at play. Hard to know which factors will weigh heavier on the price.

High interest rates make it difficult to afford monthly payments thus driving price down. If the interest rate goes down then presumably more people will be able to afford homes creating a bidding war driving prices up. This assumes that the supply of homes is held constant.

However, if the supply of homes were to simultaneously increase with the interest rate decrease then you could avoid the bidding wars because there is a house for everyone. The supply could come from people who bought homes now being able to ""upgrade"" their homes and sell the ones they currently live in.

Right now, a lot of people won't move out of their homes because they locked in a low interest rate. So the only supply available to buyers are new homes being built...which....isn't happening fast enough.

Theoretically if they dropped the interest rate to 0% again, they could free up a lot of inventory allowing people to move around and sell and buy more houses again without actually raising the prices of houses.

This is just a possible scenario...."
l196uva,Wolf_E_13,1,If interest rates go down significantly it could result in loosening up inventory...unusually low inventory is a huge problem right now and the primary reason that home prices haven't come down...demand far exceeds supply right now. A lot of people who would move...or like to move out of their homes right now won't because they're sitting on their historically low interest rates and it would cost them significantly more to move than it otherwise would in a normalized market.
l1971x1,Gogs85,1,Generally speaking interest rates ^ inflation ^ and housing is very strongly tied to inflation so it goes up too.  Also the fact that people can afford higher purchase prices because lower interest rates means the interest portion of monthly payments is down (so the principal portion has room to go up)
l19cnew,OhWhiskey,1,"The answer is depends as price is a balance between sellers and buyers, more sellers might enter the market seeing that they can get liquidated."
l19fpzv,blueraspberryslurpie,1,"Never trust the Zillow price estimators. Ever. Ever. Google ""mortgage calculator"" and actually put in the real stats. Purchase price, yearly taxes (shoot higher than normal to budget for increases), property insurance, and interest rate (shoot higher on this as well to budget for rates being different when you're actually pre-approved). For example, I just plugged in a $375k house on a mortgage calculator, with $3500 in taxes (conservative), a 7.5% rate and $1800/year insurance policy, with 20% down - you're looking at $2600 a month. This is also assuming you're out 20% down and no HOA."
l19fqke,SapientSolstice,1,"Unfortunately yes. As you said yourself, you're looking at the payment and how much you can afford, and as the interest rate decreases, you can afford more expensive houses for the same monthly payment. 

In many parts of the US, there's already a housing shortage, which means there are more people buying than selling. If the interest rate falls from 7% to 5%, the monthly payment on a $500k house falls my 15%. 

That means more people can now afford that house. And as demand increases for a fixed supply, so does price. Others, like yourself will offer more to get it, and thus the prices will start to rise to match demand."
l19ogzb,bluewater_-_,1,"Prices are going to skyrocket for a short while once rates make a meaningful change down, as it’s going to dramatically increase participation in the market. Should settle later."
l19rmkq,HazyAttorney,1,">, would the market 

There's not a singular market that works the same. It depends on your area. There's going to be places where, if more people move away than move in, then housing prices could go down. If there's places where there's more people moving in than inventory available then prices will go up.

>  
then aren't high interest rates effectively irrelevant as an impediment to home buying?

In the US, most markets do have a similarity in that there's not enough houses for population growth. Then, you also have to differentiate between new and old houses.

I live in WA state and a lot of new builders have in-house financing companies. All of them offered mortgage rates several percentages lower than what's on the market because they make more money from filling their inventory than they lose from giving below market mortgages. So that's one instance where the ""market"" has made it so the interest rates don't even matter.

Since economic activity is increasing here -- I think it's tech companies flooding California but I don't know for sure -- houses can sell within a day of being on the market. 



>would the market just adjust and inflate the price of the houses so that that same 375k house would in fact be 500k 

In Snohomish County WA, in 2016, the average house was $352k. In 2024, the average house is $752k. So maybe you can see a spike like that. But such a spike wasn't interest rates, it was the influx of tech company people who need to live somewhere."
l19w951,Evening_Treat2430,1,This is according to location and the local market. It varies between rural and urban areas.
l1a883h,whoisjohngalt72,1,Typically yes.
l1aea0y,ddbb1100,1,"If rates go down, prices will go up (affordability grows).

If rates remain constant, prices will keep on doing what they are doing.

If rates go up, will continue to have less sellers (supply drop) and prices will go up.

It’s a perfect storm of no good outcome. There’s no bubble and no “return” to previous levels"
l1aqrke,rich6490,1,Yeah your best bet is to limit your purchase to what you can afford NOW then hope to refinance in the future.

l1bgkhp,Icy_Message_2418,1,If interest rates go down home prices will stay the same for a short while and then explode
l1c6s18,Grand_Taste_8737,1,"Yes, it's possible as that may may increase demand.  If supply remains the same, and demand increases, prices will increase."
l1ddv74,gaytee,1,"When money is cheap, the value of assets goes up because cheap loans makes for more buyers. When money is expensive, the value goes down, bcz folks have less buying power, demand goes down, and list prices reflect lack of demand. 

That said, if you can afford the house now, buy it.  There is simply no expectation of rates coming down in 2024, and nobody knows what’s gonna happen based on the election.  Anyone who says otherwise is talking out of their ass, as the fed has made this very clear.  You can always refi down the line. It’s not about timing the market; it’s about time in the market.  By the time interest rates are lower, you could be happily nested and roots developing in a new home, with a couple years of equity and tax breaks. 

This all comes before inflation. 1 dollar today will be worth 75 cents in future years, but your mortgage won’t change.  That means, if your mortgage comes out to 2,000 today. That’s about the cost of a transcontinental flight to a lot of destinations.  In a few years that same flight will inflate to 3,000 dollars, but your mortgage will remain at 2,000(assuming 30 year fixed)."

l1ly4be,No-Personality-2853,1,"All things being equal, yes. But we’re still at very low inventory rates. When rates go down it’s going to free up some of that inventory also, which will act as a buffer.

The prices are so out of whack historically we just haven’t had unemployment tick up which would create the snowball effect necessary to adjust pricing."

l1nbekf,ReactionImportant491,1,"First off, my first home was at 8.25 percent, which was considered low at the time. I had friends that had rates at 14 percent. But to answer, so the best scenario here is if you buy now, then when rates go down the cost should go up, and you will refinance at the lower rate and viola, you are on your way. Personally, I think rates are going up, not down, but that call is for you to make."
l1pyokg,ncist,1,Rates on the margin should depress demand for housing as it depresses demand for everything. But practically the Fed cuts rates to increase demand and vice versa. The rates won't drop unless the housing market was already a buyers market
ld8v7yo,powerSURG,1,"A basic supply and demand curve says that it depends on which curve shifts more -- supply, or demand? If demand grows more than supply, then prices will increase.

lkc3wrp,Petrified_Powder,1,"Depends on how many homeowners are waiting for interest rates to go down before moving to another house. They don't want to lose their good mortgage. If interest rates go down, there could be a drastic increase in supply of housing causing home prices to go down. On the other hand, when interested rates go down, mortgages will be easier to afford, increasing buyers ability to purchase and therefore increasing the price of homes. It's a battle between the buyers increasing the prices and the sellers lowering the prices as the interest rates go down. So it's a matter of which side wins."
lmxr9vk,Successful-Luck7495,1,"Upto now prices are not that high, but sellers and buyers are both confused as everyone expecting interest rate as before so I don't think prices are high it will grow as interest rate go down and this will take some couple of months. "

l13q95e,probablyhrenrai,0,"All else being equal yes. Right now they'll probably keep going down for a while, because the entire market is massively down on supply (and will be for a while; new builds are ramping up, but the usual ""churn"" was *eradicated* by the ""lock-in"" effect of a best-in-40-years  rate, so supply is and will continue to be price-jackingly high for a while)."

l15grf5,cartman_returns,2,"Correct price is based on supply vs demand, when interest rates went up supply went down as you stated"
l17r10z,Able_Worker_904,1,Has housing over the last 50 or 100 years ever been flat or gone down outside of a crash?
l13250j,StockCasinoMember,111,Those 2.4% 30 years even have divorced couples sharing the house.
l13gm1n,,8,And people locked into historically low rates which leads to the low inventory
l18jsj3,ScientificBeastMode,3,"The inventory will remain low until we have a huge number forced sellers. This could be corporate offloading due to financial risk, or it could be a huge spike in unemployment leading to widespread foreclosures.

Without forced sellers, why would anyone with a low fixed interest rate sell their house? Some people would rather give up a job promotion if it meant relocating, because the additional housing costs would outweigh the pay increase. It just doesn’t make sense to sell right now unless you are forced to sell."
l131azz,,16,[deleted]
l191nuq,Great-Ad4472,2,Yeah it’s because people aren’t selling because they don’t want to buy.  We literally need people to just die in order to increase housing supply.
l1cdrkx,Whaatabutt,1,"The inventory fallacy - there are tons of homes on the market , they’re just all over priced so it’s created a “shortage.” New build starter homes are starting at $500k. Shortage of “starter homes” not homes."
l1f2upj,first_time_internet,1,Your forgetting *inflation*
l1fdhha,Thetagamer,1,the comment said housing prices go up regardless
l1feoyu,,1,"Unusually low inventory, specifically caused by unusually low pandemic rates. There's plenty of houses and people who want to sell them--but the rate delta between pandemic and today locks that supply up. 

This will be yet another case study for future economists on why letting 7 unelected people make financial policy decisions for the entire country, and by extension the world, is a garbage idea."

I bet you meant housing prices, though."
l1bxnpl,FrecciaRosa,1,This guy gets it!
l13u62g,FrecciaRosa,7,"My original post was snark, but I'll be serious for a moment. I sympathize with you. I listed my home for sale the day the Fed cranked the rate initially, and I got no interest even after I dropped the price ten percent. I lost the house I'd (finally) managed to get my offer accepted on, and I had to compromise greatly on making offers on other houses."

l17gf3l,,5,Supply is constrained by local governments NIMBYs restricting it so their home prices keep going up.
l163af9,boilergal47,7,Exactly I keep telling people cheering for a housing crash this. I was an adult in 2008. I don’t remember anyone being excited that houses were suddenly cheap because it came along with so many other awful things.
l12q8ah,shibby5000,3,"Multi-variable indeed.  And yea, during an economic downturn ppl will be losing their jobs which can contribute to a decline in demand. Or not. Who really knows! Everything becomes clear in hindsight as always"
l13ys9x,,3,I think the idea is if I save long enough and get laid off and prices crash enough it just turns into cash buyers
l18w26b,Bakingtime,1,"Interest rates are not “falling” anytime soon. 

Prices need to come down.  "
l13ze5x,Sudden-Ranger-6269,1,"????

And then more houses get put onto the market as people waiting for higher prices (or lower interest rates to buy their new house) and the supply/demand offset somewhat…

I’m buying a new house and she’s might be moving in with her mom"
l1cudw2,Immediate-Silver-203,1,"That is true. My wife and I divorced a couple Months ago and she still lives with me, even though I bought her half of the home and wrote her a sizeable check, she still wants to stay together. This is mind boggling to me, so I'm just letting it play out instead of just kicking her out. We are both 56, so no kids were involved or assets needed to be split except for the house which I bought her out."
l1ehty6,AdultingUser47,1,"bingo.  Its hard to say what will happen when rates go down because there's SO much locked up inventory that will come on the market.

No doubt buyers will show up but many sellers too, and all at once

Retirees, people divorced/separated, people trying to upsize...."
l1bxwmn,kOrEaNwUtArD,-1,Thanks to Donald Trump
l1clftl,ValueBarbarossa,1,"I just don’t think either corporate sellers or unemployed are going to en masse dump their homes like they did in 08. 

The corporates aren’t using a ton of leverage since they mostly use investor funds (like pensions and sovereign wealth funds). The individuals are all in much better financial shape. Look at the economy, nominal wages are increasing the fastest they have in 20+ years, a huge demographic issue with more boomers retiring than new workers. Plus fixed rate mortgages. No balloon payments. I just don’t think the next downturn is going to be so bad that people start selling off their houses en masse."
l196nt7,flatsun,0,What does this mean? More companies are buying houses?
l147ekq,bored_ryan2,-5,![gif](giphy|26FLgGTPUDH6UGAbm)
lkw8gj0,D34dly_Dude,2,Baby boomers will likely start dying off in the coming decade and the flood of homes entering the market could drop the prices. If that also happens while interest rates are low it will definitely be a buyers market. 
l5tzp0d,Fearless-Bet780,2,Central planning is bad.  Whether done by “experts” or elected officials.  Neither has a high probability of success when examined with some historical perspective.
l1clqbw,ValueBarbarossa,2,Investors are the least price agnostic of all buyers. Sorry to burst your bubble.

l16i3ac,Blue-Phoenix23,1,"Totally random question, but is that normally how you do things when you're going from one house to another - you pick your new house and then list yours? I've been very confused about how that works, since I need the money from the current house to get another. But I don't want to sell and then be stuck scrambling to buy or rent. I hate moving lol."

l19maor,Quick-Ad-1181,1,I know some who were excited and bought like 5 houses during the period and have a real estate empire now. It’s just luck of the draw
l1eazwa,ceotown,1,I was 29 and in the trades and bought in 2010. The housing crash of '08 was financially the best thing that's ever happened to me.
l14293f,,1,"Cash buying still seems like a horrible investment, especially when rates are low. Money would be better spent dumped into the market. If the market is down, you’re buying at a discount too. 

Mortgage still makes the most sense in my opinion. And that’s why debt it called leverage in the business world."
l19pj1k,PM_me_PMs_plox,1,"They just want to get to a 2% year over year *increase*, not for prices to come down."

l13sauh,safog1,6,Can't you just use the sale price? Why all these shenanigans around making up an appraisal so it comes in a tad higher than the actual sale price?
l14id0o,SpicyWonderBread,16,"I have joked about this with my husband. We like to say that the other can’t cheat, because we can’t afford to live apart. 

Homes on our block are selling for 20-30% more per square foot than we paid, and more than double the interest rates too. We bought the quintessential starter family home in 2021, and yet today we couldn’t afford a 2 bedroom/1 bathroom condo. Rents have shot ip so much that we probably couldn’t afford rent on an equal sized space right now either."
l175w7j,TaylorBitMe,3,"Currently in this situation. We both know we should file, but what’s the point? There’s nowhere to go."
l1afdtb,Nocryplz,1,Makes you think about how people really shouldn’t be paying more than they could afford even by themselves if people are realistic. Double income world that barely anyone has that reality for more than 10 years due to divorce or kids or both.

l1crax5,,1,"HAHAH - they absolutely are not.  

I’m a CFA charter holder and an investment banker with over ten years of experience.  My clients are some of the largest asset managers in the world.  

Those that are pouring money into single family real estate have mandates to spend XYZ dollars.  They will deploy the capital because then they get to earn the fee on AUM.  Plus they’re actively moving markets by creating their own comps.  It’s totally unregulated.  

Nice try though."
l16mfia,FrecciaRosa,2,"That's actually a super-good question! My realtor said that I should've listed my house first and then put in an offer, but it took so may years to actually get an offer accepted that I didn't want to be homeless or itinerant in the meantime. Well, turns out she was right - if I'd put my house up earlier then I would've had an offer when I made my offer, and things would have worked. Instead, I had to take myself off the market and then relist my house, THEN drive around in a hurry making offers with a huge deadline over my head. And I ended up in a house that I low-key hate. But I don't think that anyone could've foreseen the rate hike. So personally, I think that I did it the right way originally and if it hadn't been for the rate spike it would've worked fine."
l1kvgwy,FrecciaRosa,1,We can only hope!
l1e190z,,3,The thing is most people complaining about not being able to  afford a house aren’t complaint that condos are too expensive. They’re complaining that SFH are too expensive. They also want SFH. But there isn’t enough space in desirable areas for everyone to have. SFH.
l1a3imp,boilergal47,1,I guess some were able to capitalize but most people I knew (also myself) were either unemployed or so scared of losing their job that snapping up foreclosed properties wasn’t really on the radar
ljykvdb,These_Beautiful_8503,1,I’m jealous.   Good for you
l144xnj,,1,I don’t disagree but you’re talking about what if you got laid off well I take all my HYSA money making 4+% and bam house. Ideally I don’t have to wait that long but I can’t afford a $2000 mortgage plus utilities and rising taxes and insurance so something is going to have to break
l149fjx,cruisereg,1,Too many variables - I assume you’re referring to a scenario for someone without the money to buy cash.  Many retirees specifically eliminate mortgages to simplify their finances.  I’ve seen that in my neighborhood.
l19uqpk,Bakingtime,1,I will believe that when wages rise to levels that beat the past four years of inflation.
l13umzd,DJMOONPICKLES69,3,What about the folks that bought a house for $60k in Seattle in the 70s that’s now worth $3mil? They should only pay taxes for a $60k house?
l17nku7,Striking_Computer834,4,"I live in Southern California. If I were to purchase the very house I live in today, my mortgage, taxes, and insurance would cost about $5,200 a month MORE than I'm paying today. Not $5,200 total, but $5,200 more. In other words, my monthly housing costs would triple."

l1ja0j3,kOrEaNwUtArD,0,The fed watches how the economy is doing. Obviously the economy is down the drain right now. Interest rates are destroying loans taken out and money being borrowed.
l19ejl0,flatsun,1,Is that a lot?
l1cz8ak,ValueBarbarossa,2,"This is absurd. You’re saying that investors managing either their own money or others money (under drawdown funds that pay carried interest no less) are more agnostic about valuation than someone who just wants to buy the nicest house they can qualify for? Give me a break, listen to yourself. This is stupid. 

Also, I have a bunch of qualifications too, but who cares?

Perhaps you don’t think a secular theme plays into valuation? Or supply / demand or demographics? Well they do for real estate. Especially residential."
l16okk9,Blue-Phoenix23,1,"I think you're right that your way is better and the timing just sucked for you, especially since this in particular is a big fear of mine lol:

>And I ended up in a house that I low-key hate

Both the houses I've owned so far were compromises. The first was because there just wasn't enough stock (post natural disaster), and both were in the context of relationships. Like I wanted a fireplace but he needed a garage, type thing. This time I'll be doing it knowing from the beginning I'm the only one paying for it, so I don't want to get boxed in again. Hopefully when the time comes I'm ready to sell I can get a realtor that can pop me into one and sell the other fast lol"
l1eqs6f,CG8514,2,"Unfortunately there isn’t. These people should try living in the NYC metro area, where you have to knock down existing houses to build new. There aren’t any empty lots for new building and there hasn’t been for a long time (like decades)."

l19psya,PM_me_PMs_plox,1,"Wouldn't it make more sense to start with the tax burden of the $60k figure and add a 3% yearly increase or something, just to avoid the situation where a bunch of billionaires move into your neighborhood and suddenly your house is worth $6,000,000 and you can't afford the tax?"

ll3qh49,Spricklemadickle,1,"I wish it was so easy to blame one person or anyone for that matter. Economies are supposed to have ups and downs. America forgot about that and kept spending and spending. Printing more and more money. High supply of money so it's worth less and a low supply of housing makes them worth more. Now we have 10+ million migrants to find houses for when we can't house ourselves. The only way out, historically, is war, chaos or disaster. They need to raise rates if you ask me and they know that, but pressure from the election is why they're lowering rates. Which will lead to a recession if history repeats itself."
lnc082g,WHALLLEE,1,Biden is to blame for that now. Trump hasn’t been in office for years now
l19evi4,JasonG784,1,"Overall, no - but certain areas (like Phoenix, one of Opendoors first/largest markets) were hit hard by big corps like that coming in with cash offers. Great for sellers - many got more than they should have. Shit for buyers trying to compete."
l1d1euy,,1,"You’re not thinking at the right scale.  

They’re buying portfolios of homes at a time, or 10 home in a subdivision at a time.  They’re bringing top offers with surety of close.  

And let’s say they own 10 in a subdivision, and want 15 - by buying the 11th and 12th at premium creates comps that influence the market for all homes in that subdivision, including the ones they already own.  

And by deploying that capital they now get to collect fees.  They’re not deterred by rising prices.

Edit:  agree that mom and pop investors and the AB&B ‘entrepreneurs’ are also a plague on the market, and are less price agnostic, I was referring to institutional money.  Individual investors are also a driving force in the market, especially because boomers with excess cash fancy themselves wise investors by buying second and third homes to rent.  Less price agnostic, but still similar and competitive with institutional capital."
l175w0o,FrecciaRosa,2,This house is in a great school district and has separate rooms for the kids and absolutely nothing that I wanted for me. So I will wait and bide my time and in five-ten years I will move again.
l14auts,cruisereg,1,"Agreed, but you’re also talking about people that, one way or another, managed to pay off a home, often in a HCOL area, and buying cash in a MCOL/LCOL area."
l152ux1,DJMOONPICKLES69,2,Ah I misunderstood I apologize. I 100% agree with you
l19r75h,Illustrious-Ape,1,"You do realize that the assessors by law are independent from the financial institutions? They’re not the bank’s appraisers - banks answer to regulatory agencies and need to critically assess an appraisal for reasonableness. They don’t (shouldn’t) just accept it at face value. Now more than ever, banks are facing insane regulatory scrutiny subsequent to the collapse of the regional banks in 2023 and the pressures associated with toxic commercial debt."
l19u18l,AD041010,1,"Yup. I live in Maine. 1 in 5 houses are being bought by out of state investors with deep enough pockets to edge out locals. Couple that with a major drag on building any sort of housing and we are well over 20,000 housing units short. That number is up from 1 in 10 homes owned by investors in 2020. "
l17j6n5,Blue-Phoenix23,1,"Lol I know exactly what you mean about the school district and rooms for the kids. I don't want to live in my town at all really, but joint custody will do that to you. Youngest graduates in 2029 so I'm counting down hahaha"
